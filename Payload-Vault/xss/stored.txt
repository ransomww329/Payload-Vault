Stored XSS happens when your script payload gets saved on the server 
and executes for everyone who views the content.
Stored XSS is the most dangerous/valuable XSS Attack
_____________________
Example Payload:
----------------------
<script>alert('pwned')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('stored')>
<svg/onload=confirm(1337)>

This runs a popup when script tag is parsed and executed by the browser
It triggers an alert when image fails to load and runs the onerror event handler
When the page loads, the fake SVG tag tricks the browser into popping up a message box.
