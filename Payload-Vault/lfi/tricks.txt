LFI — Local File Inclusion means you trick the app into loading files from its own server.

What It Is
The app lets you include or read local files by controlling a path — like:
?page=about.html
Now you try:
?page=../../../../etc/passwd
Boom — it reads a system file. That’s LFI.

Where You Find It
?file=, ?page=, or similar parameters

Apps that use include(), require(), readfile() in PHP

Sometimes combined with upload features

What You Can Do with LFI
Read sensitive files: /etc/passwd, config files, credentials

Leak source code

Poison logs, then include the log file to get RCE

Chain with upload to execute code (upload shell, include it)

Why It’s Dangerous
Info disclosure leads to bigger exploits
Can become RCE with log poisoning
