SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
SSRF happens when a server fetches a URL you control,
and you trick it into requesting internal or restricted stuff.

Your basically using the server like a puppet to talk to things you shouldn’t reach.

Why It’s Dangerous:
Access localhost services (e.g. 127.0.0.1, http://metadata.google.internal)

hit admin panels, internal APIs, or cloud metadata

Chain it with other bugs to bypass firewalls or leak data

Example Attack URL:
https://vulnerable-site.com/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:8000
If that app blindly grabs the URL you give it?
You just made it request its own localhost.

Common Targets:
http://localhost

http://127.0.0.1

http://169.254.169.254 ← cloud creds

Internal hostnames like http://intranet.local/admin
