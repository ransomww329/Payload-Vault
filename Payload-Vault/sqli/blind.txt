Blind SQL Injection — Explained
Blind SQL Injection is like regular SQLi, but with no visible output.
You don't see errors or DB data on the page — just subtle clues.
You gotta ask yes/no questions and watch how the site reacts.

When does this happen?
The page doesn't show SQL errors.

No data is printed back.

But your input still affects the backend.

For example:
https://site.com/profile?id=1
This shows a profile. But try:

?id=1 AND 1=1  → Page loads normal  
?id=1 AND 1=2  → Page shows error, redirect, or different content
If the behavior changes, you’ve got Blind SQLi.

✅ Basic Payloads
1 AND 1=1        → True condition, page works
1 AND 1=2        → False, might break the page or show nothing

1' AND SLEEP(5)--  → If page hangs for 5 secs, injection works (time-based)
What You Can Do With It
By sending a ton of payloads, you can:

Extract table names, columns, and data

Dump usernames and passwords

Even get RCE if you chain it right

But unlike classic SQLi, you extract it 1 bit at a time, usually by:

Measuring time delay (SLEEP(5))

Watching for page content differences

Counting redirects or status codes
