Error-Based SQLi — What Is It?
Error-based SQL injection is when you force the database to throw an error, and that error reveals data right in the page.

Unlike Blind SQLi, where you get no feedback, this one just dumps info in your face if the site shows DB errors.

When Does This Work?
Site doesn’t sanitize input

Errors aren’t hidden

You inject something, and the database complains loudly

So you use that loudmouth error to your advantage 

Example Payloads

?id=1'       → Breaks query, gives SQL error  
?id=1' AND 1=1--  → Works fine  
?id=1' AND 1=2--  → Might break

?id=1' AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT COUNT(*), CONCAT(username, 0x3a, password) FROM users) AS temp)--  
That one tries to force the DB to error out while combining username:password in the error message.

Errors Might Reveal

--SQL syntax

--Table/column names

--Actual data in the error

--The DB engine (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle…)

---Why It’s Useful---

-Fastest way to dump info

-Only works if errors are visible (no filtering)

-Dead giveaway the site’s insecure as hell
