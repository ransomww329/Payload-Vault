Union-Based SQLi — What Is It
Union-based SQL injection lets you attach your own SELECT query to the original using UNION.
If the site displays DB results on the page, you can inject your own — like usernames, hashes, emails, whatever.

When Does It Work

The app builds SQL dynamically (example: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1).

Your input gets reflected on the page.

You can match the number and types of columns in the original query.

How to Tell if SQL is Dynamic
Find a URL parameter you control, like ?id=1.
Try changing it to 1' or adding logic like AND 1=1.
If the page reacts, breaks, or shows errors, the query is dynamic.

How to Use It
You test with UNION SELECT and keep tweaking until the page loads without errors — that tells you the number of columns.
Once it works, replace the placeholders with real data like username or password.
If you see that data in the page, you’ve got a working injection.

Finding the Right Number of Columns
Use tricks like ORDER BY or keep adding values in UNION SELECT until it stops throwing errors.
The page loading normally tells you you’ve matched the structure.

Why Union SQLi Is Useful

Fastest way to dump visible data.

Works great when app reflects output on the page.

You can extract full tables like users, emails, login data.
